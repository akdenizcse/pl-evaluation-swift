Swift Programming Language

  Swift developed by under the leadership of Chris Lattner which be software engineer in the Aplle with Doug Gregor, John McCall, Ted Kremenek, Joe Groff and Aple Inc. Swift announced in  2 June 2014  at Apple Worldwide Developers Conferance .
While the Swift language was creating, many features from many other languages were taken. These languages are Objective-C, Rust, Haskell, Ruby, Python,  While the Swift language was creating, many features from many other languages were taken. These languages are Objective C, Rust, Haskell, Ruby, Python, C#, Clu, Dlang.  It was very much affected by Objective C.

Why was invented ?

  Objective C, is the main development language of IOS and MacOS systems. Objective C is a language that built on the C language by adding object-oriented features. We should know C language before start to learn Swift language. So the cost of learning Objective C is higher than the costs of learning other languages. Apple wanted to produce a new language which be modern and easy to learn to reduce this challenge. As a result Apple designed Swift programming langauge. 
  
  When/why shall we use it ?
  
  Swift is a language that has been designed to develop products for Apple devices in general. So using Swift, it is possible to develop applications that can run smoothly on macOS, tvOS, iPadOS, watchOS and iOS devices.. But, there is an exception in this regard. Swift is an open source language, so it can work on other open source operating systems like Linux.  It is possible to develop an applications that can run on the Linux operating system using Swift.  But  Swift was originally designed to work on Apple products. That's why Swift is the programming language that can use the equipment of Apple products most efficiently.
If we want to develop an applications for Apple products, Swift is the best choice

Why
1)	Swift to write and read is easier than many programming languages. When we compared to Objective-C, the number of codes that must be written to do the same operations is lesser than Objective C . So the product development process is faster. 
For example  with Objective-C
